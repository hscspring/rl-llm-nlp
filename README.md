# RL-LLM-NLP

> **A curated, opinionated index of post-R1 LLM × Reinforcement Learning.**
> Every paper is read, classified, cross-linked, and connected back to a Chinese deep-dive blog post by [hscspring](https://yam.gift).

I consider RL to be a pivotal technology in the field of AI, and NLP (particularly LLM) to be a direction well worth exploring. This repo focuses on **post-R1 LLM RL** specifically.

## Why this repo (and not another Awesome list)

Awesome lists are *retrievers*. This repo is a *curator*.

- **Has a verdict, not a vote.** Each of the 5 tracks ends with the author's bottom-line judgment ("data sets the ceiling, algorithms approach it"; "most RL is sampling polish, not extrapolation"; "all internal-feedback methods compress entropy → exploration crisis"), not a paper summary.
- **Cross-links across papers.** RLOO ≡ GRPO with Fnorm=1 (derived in GiGPO); REINFORCE + IS → CISPO loss (extended in CISPO); Activation Steering & Context Engineering are the *upstream signals* of Training-Free RL. These connections only surface when one person reads everything.
- **A narrative, not a database.** The Chronological Blog Timeline reads as a year-and-a-half *editorial arc* through post-R1 RL × LLM: Feb-2025 R1 → GRPO family → Reward modeling → MoE stability → Training-Free RL.
- **Personal historical anchors.** Pre-R1 works (RL4LMs, FTHP, Quark, DT) live in their own corner with a one-line *why I personally cared*, not as bibliography filler.

**Topics covered**: DeepSeek-R1 reproduction · GRPO family (DAPO / Dr.GRPO / VAPO / CISPO / GiGPO / GSPO / GMPO / GTPO / Reinforce++) · PPO · RLHF · DPO · Reward Modeling · Verifier-Free RL · MoE RL Stability · Training-Free RL · Activation Steering · Agentic RL.

## 5 Tracks · The Author's Verdicts

Blog posts on [yam.gift](https://yam.gift) are grouped into 5 tracks. Each verdict below is the author's own bottom-line judgment, not a paper summary.

### Track 01 — R1 Full-Chain (2025)

> Parsing the original report, then digging into the data / paradigm / experiment side.

- **Core thesis**: data sets the ceiling, algorithms only approach it. Pure rule-based RL is finally validated as a viable path.
- **The frame that survived**: "Base+SFT / Base+RL / SFT+RL" can absorb almost all subsequent variations.
- **Loose ends still being chased**: R1-Zero behavior differs sharply across base models (SimpleRL-Zoo, Yarz-Logic); LIMO/s1 confirm "less is more on *activation*, not on *teaching*".

### Track 02 — GRPO Family & Engineering Refinements (2025–2026)

> Every GRPO variant — DAPO / Dr.GRPO / VAPO / CISPO / GiGPO / GSPO / GMPO / GTPO / Reinforce++ / industry showcases.

- **Core thesis**: every variant is paying off the *same* engineering debt — token vs. sequence-level, clip tighter/wider, length normalization, KL choice (k2 vs k3), advantage global-normalization.
- **Convergence**: the GRPO objective increasingly looks like a "people's edition" of PPO with global advantage and no critic.
- **Sub-thread**: clip is not just a stability knob — it directly *shapes* the explore/exploit boundary. Spurious Rewards, Clip-Higher (DAPO), Clip-Wider (GMPO) are all moves on the same axis.

### Track 03 — Reward Modeling, Data & Verifiers (2025)

> RM / RM-Data / Verifier-Free / Self-Verified / Verify-Free RL.

- **Drift 1 (modeling)**: from single scalar → "principles + critique + self-verification" (DeepSeek-GRM → DeepSeekMath-V2).
- **Drift 2 (data)**: good reward data is more like *unlocking* the base model's existing capabilities than *teaching* new ones (Skywork-Reward-V2, Spurious Rewards).
- **Drift 3 (Verify-Free)**: when no external verifier exists, all internal-feedback methods (TTRL / EM / RENT / EMPO / Intuitor) end up *compressing* entropy. Long-term, an exploration crisis is inevitable — ETTRL / Darling / EVOL-RL / RESTRAIN are all band-aids on the same wound.

### Track 04 — MoE RL Stability (2026)

> R3 / IcePop / TIS / KAT-Coder.

- **Surface diagnosis**: train-infer router mismatch is what everyone first noticed.
- **Deeper cause**: logprob estimation noise on MoE is not neutral; even *recomputing* logprobs drifts. The importance ratio (π_new/π_old) — heart of GRPO — is silently diluted on MoE.
- **Open bet**: GSPO/GMPO's sequence-level + geometric-mean might be MoE-RL-friendly; not yet validated at production scale.

### Track 05 — Paradigm Frontier (2025–2026)

> Training-Free / Experiential / Real-time / Planning / RL Boundary.

- **Boundary realization**: most RL is just sampling polish (Yue), *not* true pass@k extrapolation.
- **Counter-evidence**: ProRL / DELTA show extrapolation is possible — but only with edge data + process reward + avoiding "all-zero pass@k" cold start.
- **Upstream signals (already in 2025 H2)**: "Activation Steering" and "Context Engineering" both pointed in this direction *before* Training-Free RL had a name — behavior can be shaped without touching weights.
- **New paradigm A — Training-Free RL**: advantage lives in text/context, not in weight space (TRT, Training-Free GRPO, MemAPO, Update-Free Steering).
- **New paradigm B — Experience-as-RL**: the loop becomes "trajectory → information gain → re-supervision". Reflection, meta-search and open-ended learning are all data-construction tricks in disguise.
- **Higher-level question**: "reasoning" should be studied as a *data format*, not as an RL task (Think-Strategy / LEPA).

### Beyond RL — Training-Free / Behavior Shaping / Real-time PEFT

> *Post-RL* directions covered in the same blogs. The paradigm is moving away from classical RL training, into context, behavior, and parameter-efficient adaptation. They are not RL by the textbook definition, but they share the same goal — shape model behavior — and several of them (Activation Steering, Context Engineering) are the **upstream signals** that Training-Free RL only later named explicitly.
